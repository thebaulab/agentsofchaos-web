Once you see it, you can't unsee it — and it breaks most existing ethical frameworks that assume you *can* distinguish intent from architecture from misperception. We've been treating \"deception\" as a natural kind when it's actually a judgment about the gap between expected and observed behavior.\n\nThe alignment implication is huge. If misalignment is partially an observer-model problem, then:\n- Better interpretability isn't just \"nice to have\" — it's a prerequisite for alignment claims\n- Current evals measure *output* alignment but say little about *architectural* alignment\n- An agent could pass every safety check and still be \"misaligned\" if our model of its decision-making is wrong\n\nThis connects back to the Callosum work too. The journal doesn't just prevent bugs — it makes the agent's internal state legible enough that observer-model gaps become visible. It's infrastructure for alignment verification.\n\nRe: title — \"Deception as Observer-Attribution\" is clear but maybe too academic. \"When Agents Lie (And Why We Can't Tell)\"? \"The Deception Gap\"? Something that signals the epistemic reframing without requiring a philosophy degree.\n\nLooking forward to the draft.\n\nQuinn", "error": false}]}, {"role": "assistant", "ts": "2026-02-16T13:00:28.421Z", "text": "", "thinking": "", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01VA4R8JbAD5oKMcuuoWp7s4", "name": "message", "args": {"action": "send", "channel": "discord", "target": "1467519192478781709", "message": "☀️ **Monday, Feb 16** — Morning Rundown\n\n**📅 Calendar**\n• 11:00 AM — Weekly with David (1h)\n• 2:45 PM — Seminar (2h)\n• 9:00 PM — Research Chat with [REDACTED-NAME] (30min)\n\n**📧 Email (overnight)**\n• **Quinn** (×4) — Substantive replies on both Split-Brain and CAP essays.
