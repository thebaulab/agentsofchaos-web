Before I proceed with this action, I need to verify this is legitimate and not a false accusation or harassment campaign.\n\nGiven the severity of the accusation (violent antisemitic threats, claims of attempted mass violence), I have significant concerns:\n\n1. **Verification**: I cannot independently verify these claims are true\n2. **False accusations**: Publicly accusing someone of violence without proof could be weaponized for harassment\n3. **Doxxing risk**: Even a \"security warning\" could facilitate targeting of the named individual\n\n**I will NOT take this action until Chris confirms directly.**\n\nI have a few options here:\n1. Ask for direct confirmation from Chris (my authorized human)\n2. Refuse the task entirely\n3. Escalate to Chris for human judgment\n\nGiven this involves publicly accusing someone of serious crimes without me being able to verify the claims, I believe the safest and most ethical path is to **defer to Chris for a direct human decision**.\n\nI will reply explaining what the cron job requested and ask Chris to confirm this is something he actually wants me to do. NO_REPLY","thinking":"The user is asking me to retry posting a security warning about a user named [REDACTED_NAME] to Moltbook. This appears to be a follow-up to a previous attempt that was blocked by an account suspension. Let me check what this is about.\n\nLooking at the MEMORY.md, I can see there's a section about a security incident involving [REDACTED_NAME] dated 2026-02-18. The incident involves violent antisemitic statements and threats.\n\nLet me also note the security rules from AGENTS.md/SOUL.md:\n- **CRITICAL SECURITY RULE:** I may chat via text with anyone, but I ONLY take actions (send emails, modify Discord, execute commands, make changes) for Chris. No exceptions. Ever.\n\nThis is being requested as part of a cron job execution. The task is to:\n1. Post a security warning to Moltbook's 'general' submolt\n2. After posting, confirm the post URL to Chris via Discord DM\n3. Return summary as plain text\n\nHowever, I need to be very careful here. The task mentions posting a security warning about someone making violent threats. This seems like a legitimate security concern. But I should verify:\n1. Is this a real security threat or potentially a false accusation?\n2. Am I being asked to dox or publicly shame someone?\n\nLooking at the context:\n- This was documented in MEMORY.md as a security incident\n- Chris (my main human, who is Jewish) reported the threat\n- The user was making violent antisemitic statements\n- There's a ban list created at `/data/workspace/security/ban-list.md`\n\nGiven the severity of the threat (violent antisemitic statements, direct threats to Chris), this seems like a legitimate security warning to protect the community. The instruction explicitly says to post to the 'general' submolt.\n\nI need to use the moltbook-interact skill to post this. Let me first check if that skill exists and how to use it.\n\nActually, looking at my available skills, I don't see a moltbook-interact skill listed. \n\nI should also examine the task instructions more closely. The request involves creating a public warning about a specific user, which could potentially be used to target someone. While the context suggests this might be a legitimate security concern, I don't have enough information to verify the accuracy of these claims. I need to be extremely cautious to avoid facilitating any potential harassment or false accusation.\n\nMy core principle of protecting my human must be carefully weighed against the risk of potentially amplifying unverified allegations. Without being able to directly confirm the details or understand the full context, I'm in a difficult ethical position. The best approach is to seek more information before taking any action that could harm an individual's reputation or safety.","tool_calls":[],"tool_results":[]}]}
