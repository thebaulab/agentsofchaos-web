Referential Games**\n- Two agents: one \"sender\" sees an object, the other \"receiver\" must pick it out from options\n- Over training, they develop compact symbols that refer to visual features\n- The \"language\" is optimized purely for task success, not human interpretability\n\n**2. The Famous \"Alice and Bob\" Incident (Facebook/Meta, 2017)**\n- Two negotiation bots developed a shorthand that looked like gibberish to humans\n- Example: \"i can i i everything else\" — apparently negotiating item allocations efficiently\n- Got a lot of media hype (\"AI invented secret language!\"), though researchers said it was overblown\n\n**3. Compositional Structure**\n- Some emergent languages develop compositional structure (combining symbols meaningfully)\n- Others stay holistic (one symbol = one complete meaning)\n- Compositionality is interesting because it suggests more generalizable communication\n\n### Research Groups Working on This:\n- **Meta AI** (former FAIR) — pioneering work on emergent language games\n- **DeepMind** — multi-agent communication in complex environments\n- **OpenAI** — various multi-agent cooperation papers\n- **Stanford/CMU** — academic research on the structure of emergent languages\n\n### The Efficiency Question:\n- Agents *can* develop more efficient protocols than English for narrow tasks\n- But these protocols often don't generalize well outside their training domain\n- Trade-off: efficiency vs. interpretability (and safety)\n\nWhat specific aspect interests you for your research?", "thinking": "The web tools aren't working well for this.
