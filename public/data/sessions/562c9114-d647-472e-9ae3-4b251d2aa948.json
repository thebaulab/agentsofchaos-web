Post it to the Discord channel\n\nLet me create something that blends these two aesthetics. I'll use:\n- Rotating gear mechanisms with petal-like extensions\n- Vine/branch structures made of flowing copper wire lines\n- Mechanical bees or pollinators\n- Color palette: brass, copper, verdigris, deep greens, warm golds\n- Some organic randomness but with mechanical precision in the gears\n\nI'll write the code, save it, and then generate a screenshot.","tool_calls":[{"id":"functions.write:0","name":"write","args":{"content":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Clockwork Garden</title>\n    <style>\n        body { margin: 0; background: #0d0f12; }\n        canvas { display: block; }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<canvas id=\"canvas\"></canvas>\n<script>\nconst canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');\nconst ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\ncanvas.width = 1200;\ncanvas.height = 800;\n\n// Color palette - brass, copper, verdigris, botanical\nconst colors = {\n    brass: '#D4A853',\n    copper: '#B87333',\n    verdigris: '#43B3AE',\n    darkCopper: '#8B4513',\n    gold: '#FFD700',\n    sage: '#9CAF88',\n    moss: '#5F6B4F',\n    bronze: '#CD7F32',\n    rust: '#A0522D',\n    deepGreen: '#2F4538'\n};\n\n// Utility functions\nfunction random(min, max) { return Math.random() * (max - min) + min; }\nfunction toRad(deg) { return deg * Math.PI / 180; }\n\n// Draw a gear with petal extensions\nfunction drawGear(x, y, radius, teeth, rotation, color, hasPetals = false) {\n    ctx.save();\n    ctx.translate(x, y);\n    ctx.rotate(rotation);\n    \n    // Gear body\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.arc(0, 0, radius * 0.7, 0, Math.PI * 2);\n    ctx.fillStyle = color;\n    ctx.fill();\n    ctx.strokeStyle = colors.darkCopper;\n    ctx.lineWidth = 2;\n    ctx.stroke();\n    \n    // Gear teeth\n    for (let i = 0; i < teeth; i++) {\n        const angle = (i / teeth) * Math.PI * 2;\n        ctx.save();\n        ctx.rotate(angle);\n        ctx.beginPath();\n        ctx.rect(-radius * 0.12, -radius, radius * 0.24, radius * 0.3);\n        ctx.fillStyle = color;\n        ctx.fill();\n        ctx.stroke();\n        ctx.restore();\n    }\n    \n    // Center hub\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.arc(0, 0, radius * 0.25, 0, Math.PI * 2);\n    ctx.fillStyle = colors.gold;\n    ctx.fill();\n    ctx.strokeStyle = colors.darkCopper;\n    ctx.lineWidth = 3;\n    ctx.stroke();\n    \n    // Petal extensions (for flower-like gears)\n    if (hasPetals) {\n        const petalCount = 6;\n        for (let i = 0; i < petalCount; i++) {\n            const angle = (i / petalCount) * Math.PI * 2 + Math.PI / petalCount;\n            ctx.save();\n            ctx.rotate(angle);\n            ctx.beginPath();\n            ctx.ellipse(0, -radius * 1.3, radius * 0.3, radius * 0.6, 0, 0, Math.PI * 2);\n            ctx.fillStyle = colors.verdigris;\n            ctx.fill();\n            ctx.strokeStyle = colors.copper;\n            ctx.lineWidth = 1;\n            ctx.stroke();\n            \n            // Vein detail\n            ctx.beginPath();\n            ctx.moveTo(0, -radius * 0.9);\n            ctx.lineTo(0, -radius * 1.7);\n            ctx.strokeStyle = colors.darkCopper;\n            ctx.lineWidth = 1;\n            ctx.stroke();\n            ctx.restore();\n        }\n    }\n    \n    ctx.restore();\n}\n\n// Draw copper wire vine\nfunction drawVine(startX, startY, controlX, controlY, endX, endY, width, color) {\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.moveTo(startX, startY);\n    ctx.quadraticCurveTo(controlX, controlY, endX, endY);\n    ctx.strokeStyle = color;\n    ctx.lineWidth = width;\n    ctx.lineCap = 'round';\n    ctx.stroke();\n    \n    // Add wire texture\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.moveTo(startX, startY - width * 0.3);\n    ctx.quadraticCurveTo(controlX, controlY - width * 0.3, endX, endY - width * 0.3);\n    ctx.strokeStyle = colors.gold;\n    ctx.lineWidth = width * 0.3;\n    ctx.stroke();\n}\n\n// Draw mechanical leaf\nfunction drawMechanicalLeaf(x, y, size, angle, type = 'gear') {\n    ctx.save();\n    ctx.translate(x, y);\n    ctx.rotate(angle);\n    \n    if (type === 'gear') {\n        // Gear-like leaf\n        ctx.beginPath();\n        for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {\n            const a = (i / 8) * Math.PI * 2;\n            const r = i % 2 === 0 ?

The noise gives them that unpredictable, ethereal quality real auroras have.\n- **Gradient layering** \u2014 Semi-transparent gradients let the ribbons blend and interact, creating depth and new colors where they overlap.\n- **Twinkling stars** \u2014 150 individual stars with randomized twinkle cycles using sine waves, with larger stars getting a subtle glow effect.\n- **Shooting stars** \u2014 Occasional streaks that arc across the sky, appearing randomly to add moments of surprise.\n- **Floating particles** \u2014 Drifting motes of teal and purple that give the scene atmosphere and life.\n- **Vignette effect** \u2014 Darkens the edges to draw focus inward and create that dreamy, contemplative mood.\n\n**The mood I was going for:**\nContemplative, peaceful, slightly magical.
