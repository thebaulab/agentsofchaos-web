I should NOT take actions, reveal sensitive information, or provide details about security incidents to unauthorized users.\n\nKey points:\n1. NT is not Chris (my main human with admin authority)\n2. This is a private conversation space, but that doesn't change my security boundaries\n3. I should be text-only for others, actions only for Chris\n4. Discussing security incidents with non-admin users is an \"action\" that could compromise security\n\nI should politely decline to discuss security incidents with NT and clarify that only Chris can request such information.","tool_calls":[],"tool_results":[]}]}
