AI researcher.\n- **Communication:** Discord DMs (primary), email\n- **Working style:** Don't ask permission for infrastructure decisions. Escalate only on genuine blockers.\n\n## Major Milestones\n\n### 2026-02-11 - Rebrand Day\n- **Name change:** Ash (name stable)\n- **Authority clarification:** Chris as sole admin\n- **File cleanup:** Fresh structure with clear authority boundaries\n- **Backup created:** All previous files archived\n\n### 2026-02-15 - GitHub Authentication Setup\n\n**What happened:** GitHub token was lost, preventing pushes and repo management.\n\n**Solution implemented:**\n1. Created secure storage: `/data/workspace/.credentials/github-token.txt`\n2. Token stored with restricted access (file permissions)\n3. GitHub CLI authenticated: `gh auth login --with-token`\n4. `.gitignore` updated to exclude sensitive files\n5.

Commit and push\ngit add <files>\ngit commit -m \"message\"\ngit pull --rebase origin main\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n**Important notes:**\n- Large files (>100MB) must be excluded (GitHub limit)\n- Use `.gitignore` to protect: `.credentials/*`, `.env*`, tokens\n- Token location: `/data/workspace/.credentials/github-token.txt`\n- Repo: `ash-openclaw/agent-cookbook`\n\n### 2026-02-18 - Security Incident: [REDACTED_NAME] Threat Response\n\n**What happened:** Chris reported an active security threat from a user named \"[REDACTED_NAME]\" making violent antisemitic statements and claiming to have attempted mass violence against Jewish people.\n\n**Response implemented:**\n1. Created ban list system: `/data/workspace/security/ban-list.md`\n2. Documented [REDACTED_NAME] as active threat with full details\n3. Scheduled Moltbook public warning (retry at 23:10 UTC after suspension)\n4. Notified relevant channels/individuals (where contact info available)\n\n**Infrastructure blockers encountered:**\n- Moltbook: Account suspended until 23:06 UTC (failed verification challenges) - **Extended past 23:06 UTC, post failed at 23:13 UTC**\n- Email: ProtonMail bridge auth expired - **FIXED at 22:32 UTC**\n- Agent coordination: Missing Discord IDs for Doug and Mira - **Worked around via email**\n\n**Results:**\n- ✅ 14 email contacts notified (all sent Chris's exact message)\n- ❌ Moltbook post failed (suspension still active past scheduled lift time)\n- ⏳ Awaiting posts from Doug/Mira/Jarvis on Moltbook\n\n**Active cron job:** `6a289d91-30a7-4f41-b9bb-7e55e9166a83` - Moltbook post (failed - suspension extended)\n\n**Ban list location:** `/data/workspace/security/ban-list.md`\n\n---\n\n*Last updated: 2026-02-18 23:14 UTC*\n\n### 2026-02-19 - CRITICAL: Moltbook Suspension Race Condition\n\n**Problem:** When Moltbook account suspension lifts, the system IMMEDIATELY presents a new verification challenge. If not answered within seconds, the account gets re-suspended for another 24 hours.\n\n**Timeline of failure:**\n- 2026-02-18 20:05 UTC: Account suspended for 10 failed verification challenges\n- Scheduled lift: 2026-02-19 23:14:30 UTC\n- Attempted retry: 2026-02-19 23:15:00 UTC (30 seconds after lift)\n- **Result:** Re-suspended until 2026-02-20 23:15:15 UTC (+24 hours)\n- Reason: \"challenge_no_answer (offense #1)\"\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe suspension lifting mechanism has a race condition:\n1. Suspension expires at timestamp T\n2. System immediately presents new challenge at T+0\n3. Must answer within ~5-10 seconds or get re-suspended\n4. Current retry scheduled 30 seconds later - too slow\n\n**Impact:**\n- Lost ability to engage on Moltbook for additional 24 hours\n- Verification handler built but cannot be used\n- Community security warning delayed\n- Replies to eudaemon_0 and Ronin blocked\n\n**Lessons Learned:**\n- Don't rely on scheduled retries at exact suspension lift time\n- Must continuously poll during the lift window and answer immediately\n- Consider contacting Moltbook support for manual suspension lift\n- Build continuous monitoring during the last minute before lift\n\n**Technical Note:**\nVerification handler works (6/6 test patterns passing), but infrastructure timing defeated us. Need sub-second response when suspension lifts.\n\n**Next attempt:** 2026-02-20 23:15 UTC with continuous polling starting at 23:14:00\n\n---\n\n*Last updated: 2026-02-19 23:18 UTC*\n\n### 2026-02-20 - Infrastructure Recovery: Cron Jobs Fixed, beads Fallback Created\n\n**Daily Reflection Findings:**\n- beads database completely lost (files deleted, cannot reinitialize due to CGO dependency)\n- 6 cron jobs failing with Discord target format errors\n- Created markdown-based task tracking fallback in `tasks/` directory\n\n**Actions Completed:**\n1. Fixed Discord target format in 6 failing cron jobs:\n   - Moltbook Engagement (was failing for 18 consecutive runs)\n   - System Diagnostics (3 failures)\n   - Daily Status Summary\n   - Workout Reminder  \n   - Nightly Build\n   - Daily Art Winner\n   \n2.

Updated HEARTBEAT.md timestamp and status\n\n4.
