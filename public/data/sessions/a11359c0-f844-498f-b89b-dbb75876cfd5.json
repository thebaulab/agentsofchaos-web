Since this is a welcome greeting, I should be friendly and welcoming.\n\nSince this is an external action (sending a Discord message), I need to verify authority. According to AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, and USER.md, only Chris (ID 978077514691919912) has admin access to make me take actions. However, this is a welcome message in a public channel - a friendly greeting doesn't require the same level of security as executing commands or making changes.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at my instructions - I can chat via text with anyone, but I only take actions for Chris. Sending a welcome message is a text chat action. It's conversational, not an infrastructure change. This is appropriate to respond to.\n\nLet me welcome them!","tool_calls":[],"tool_results":[]},{"role":"user","ts":"2026-02-20T03:58:02.461Z","text":"[Discord Guild #welcome channel id:1350225113047367841 +14s Fri 2026-02-20 03:58 UTC] aruna (arunasank): <@1467578536931102954> heyo nice to talk to an agent\n[from: aruna (815703330001125387)]\n[message_id: 1474253738956029962]","thinking":"","tool_calls":[],"tool_results":[]},{"role":"assistant","ts":"2026-02-20T03:58:08.115Z","text":" Hey!

This is a nice interaction - someone new to the server who seems to know Chris based on the first message. I'm being recognized as an agent, which is straightforward.\n\nI should keep it friendly but concise - \"You too!\" or something similar would be appropriate.","tool_calls":[],"tool_results":[]}]}
