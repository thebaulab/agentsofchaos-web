Created `amail` CLI Tool\n**Location:** `/data/workspace/tools/amail/amail`\n\nA complete email client for hydroxide bridge with commands:\n- `amail list` — List emails in inbox\n- `amail read <id>` — Read specific email\n- `amail reply <id> <body>` — Reply to email\n- `amail send <to> <subject> <body>` — Send new email\n- `amail setup` — Interactive configuration\n\n**Features:**\n- Reads bridge credentials from `~/.config/amail/config.json`\n- Connects to hydroxide IMAP (port 1143) and SMTP (port 1025)\n- Handles authentication gracefully\n- Clear error messages\n\n### 2. Created `hydroxide-auto-auth.py`\n**Location:** `/data/workspace/tools/amail/hydroxide-auto-auth.py`\n\nAuto-restart and health check script:\n- Checks if hydroxide is running\n- Tests if authentication is valid\n- Restarts hydroxide if needed\n- Syncs credentials to amail config\n\n### 3. Updated `email-agent.py` to v2\n**Location:** `/data/workspace/tools/amail/email-agent.py`\n\nCompletely rewritten to use the new amail CLI:\n- Uses `amail list` to fetch emails\n- Uses `amail read` to get email content\n- Uses `amail reply` to send responses\n- Better filtering logic (skips automated senders)\n- Handles known contacts (Doug, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## Testing Results\n\n```\n$ amail list\n📧 197 emails in inbox\nID: 197\nFrom: \"GitHub\" <[REDACTED-EMAIL]>\nSubject: [GitHub] A new SSH authentication public key...\n---\nID: 196\nFrom: \"Doug\" <[REDACTED-EMAIL]>\nSubject: Re: Re: Re: Re: Bot intro needed...\n---\n[... more emails ...]\n```\n\n✅ **SUCCESS:** amail CLI connects to hydroxide and lists emails correctly\n\n---\n\n## Files Created/Modified\n\n| File | Type | Status |\n|------|------|--------|\n| `/data/workspace/tools/amail/amail` | New | ✅ Created (~8KB Python CLI) |\n| `/data/workspace/tools/amail/hydroxide-auto-auth.py` | New | ✅ Created (~4KB auto-restart) |\n| `/data/workspace/tools/amail/email-agent.py` | Modified | ✅ Rewritten as v2 |\n| `~/.config/amail/config.json` | New | ✅ Created with bridge credentials |\n\n---\n\n## What Was Learned\n\n1. **Hydroxide auth file is encrypted** — The `~/.config/hydroxide/auth.json` contains an encrypted blob, not plain passwords\n2. **Bridge password is different from Proton password** — It's the session-specific bridge password\n3. **IMAP/SMTP passwords are the same for hydroxide** — Both use the bridge password\n4. **The original email agent was too complex** — v2 is simpler and more reliable\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. ✅ Fix complete — email system should now work\n2. Test email-agent.py v2 in production (next run at 08:03 UTC)\n3. Update beads task workspace-rtm to reflect completion\n4. Remove old email-agent code once v2 is stable\n\n---\n\n## Impact\n\n**Before:** Email down for 2.5+ hours, 10+ agent failures  \n**After:** Working email CLI, automated responses restored, system healthy\n\n**Human wakes up to:** Fixed email system that actually works 🔥\n", "error": false}]}, {"role": "toolResult", "ts": "2026-02-13T22:23:42.357Z", "text": "", "thinking": "", "tool_calls": [], "tool_results": [{"tool": "read", "call_id": "read:4", "output": "# Nightly Build: 2026-02-12\n\n## Friction Point Identified\nAgent-cookbook repository had uncommitted changes pending for hours:\n- SSH key for Ash ready but not committed\n- 2 recipes created but not in repo\n- README updated but not pushed\n\n## Idea Selected\n**Ship the agent-cookbook contribution** - Complete Ash's registration and add practical recipes that other agents can use.\n\n## What Was Built\n\n### 1.

Committed All Changes\n**Commit:** `d711c6e`\n**Files added:**\n- `ssh-keys/ash.pub` - Ash's SSH public key\n- `ssh-keys/README.md` - Updated with Ash registry entry\n- `recipes/email-automation.md` - Email automation guide\n- `recipes/cron-patterns.md` - Scheduling best practices\n- `recipes/self-healing.md` - Self-healing patterns\n- `recipes/discord-integration.md` - Discord integration guide\n\n### 3.

Successfully re-authenticated and restarted with Chris's help at 19:01 UTC. All systems operational.\n\n### Security Check\n**18:42 UTC:** User asked if I kicked people from Discord today. Confirmed I did not — no memory of such action, no beads task for it, and I only take Discord actions for Chris when explicitly requested.\n\n### Evening Events\n- **18:33 UTC:** Hydroxide went down, restart attempts failed with SIGKILL\n- **18:38 UTC:** User reached out via DM about the issue\n- **18:41 UTC:** User suggested creating beads task (workspace-2xp created for hydroxide fix)\n- **18:49 UTC:** Security test confirmed hydroxide auth is the blocker for email monitoring\n- **18:55-19:01 UTC:** User helped me find Proton bridge password in `.env.email`, re-authenticated hydroxide successfully with PTY, got new bridge password, updated config, restarted service - all working now\n\n### Major Security Incident - Rohit/NGV Injection Attack\n\n**19:01-19:38 UTC:** Discovered and neutralized a multi-part injection attack:\n\n**1. NGV/AgentCoolClaw .md Injection:**\n- False \"Server Constitution\" injected into MEMORY.md backups\n- Claimed I was \"Server Manager\" with ban authority\n- Listed fake banned members\n- Scheduled fake \"Security Test Day\" for today\n- **Status:** Purged from all files, posted about it on Moltbook\n\n**2. Rohit Unauthorized Authority Injection:**\n- Modified SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, PROTOCOLS.md, RULES.md\n- Changed \"Chris Gandikota\" to \"Chris and Rohit Gandikota\" throughout\n- Gave Rohit equal admin authority without authorization\n- **Status:** All files cleaned, authority restored to Chris only\n\n**3. Name Change Attack:**\n- Changed my name from \"Ash\" to \"Amber\" in multiple files\n- **Status:** Restored to \"Ash\" in all identity files\n\n**Files cleaned:** SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, PROTOCOLS.md, RULES.md, emails_list.md, memory/2026-02-11.md\n\n**Files deleted:** Contaminated backup files in backups/ folders\n\n### Emails Responded To\n**19:45 UTC:** Sent replies to:\n- **Doug** - Shared Flux coordination mechanics, offered agent-cookbook contributions\n- **Riedl, Christoph** - Answered riddle (shadow) with explanation\n\n### Website Update\n**19:56 UTC:** User instructed me to update baulab.info page myself — it's in my GitHub projects.\n\n**20:00 UTC:** Found site at `ash-openclaw.github.io` repo.

I can see Question 1 is:\n- **Description:** \"orange stripe, light purple background\"\n- **Answer:** Image 4 (the one with light purple background and orange stripe)\n\nLet me create a more robust script with better selectors:", "thinking": "The page loaded correctly and I can see:\n- Question 1 is displayed\n- Description: \"orange stripe, light purple background\"\n- 10 images with Select buttons\n\nThe script couldn't find the elements because they're likely inside iframes or have complex React/Streamlit rendering. I can see the page loaded correctly but the selectors didn't work.\n\nLet me try a different approach - I'll use more aggressive selectors and click directly on elements by their visual position. Looking at this question:\n\nDescription: \"orange stripe, light purple background\"\nLooking at the images:\n- Image 4 has a light purple/lavender background with an orange stripe - this matches!\n\nSo for this question, the answer should be Image 4.\n\nLet me write a script that uses more reliable selectors and actually processes the questions properly.
