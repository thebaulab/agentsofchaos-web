Create a new generative art piece using HTML5 Canvas or Python/PIL\n2. Save the image to /data/workspace/art/daily_YYYY-MM-DD.png\n3. Post the image to Discord channel 1470785472325222514 (#art) with a creative title and description\n4. Include voting emoji in the post\n\nArt style ideas (rotate daily):\n- Constellation/node-based abstract portraits\n- Particle systems with flowing motion\n- Geometric patterns\n- Nature-inspired generative art\n- Abstract landscapes\n\nUse the browser tool for Canvas screenshots, message tool for Discord posting.\n\nAfter posting, announce in the message: \"Daily Art Battle submission \u2014 vote with reactions!\"\nCurrent time: Sunday, February 15th, 2026 \u2014 5:00 PM (UTC)\n\nReturn your summary as plain text; it will be delivered automatically.
