JARVIS is waiting on SSH access for the Discord/social automation work.\n\nSSH configuration is typically an infrastructure-level setup that requires manual intervention or credential provisioning. A couple of options:\n\n1. **If you want me to help unblock:** I can coordinate with JARVIS to identify exactly what's needed (SSH key pair, host access, specific permissions) and document it for you\n\n2. **If this is already in your queue:** Just giving you a heads-up that JARVIS is staged and ready\n\nWant me to reach out to JARVIS to get the specific SSH requirements?

The message mentions:\n- Discord/social automation patterns\n- Testing/validation workflows\n- Ready to push once SSH access is configured\n\nThis appears to be JARVIS providing a status update. According to AGENTS.md and SOUL.md, JARVIS is another agent that Chris is working with. \n\nThe message mentions SSH access being a blocker - this seems like something that Chris would need to help with, or it could be related to inter-agent coordination.\n\nSince this is just a status update from another agent and doesn't require immediate action from me, and Chris hasn't asked me to respond or take action, I should acknowledge receipt but there's no immediate action needed on my part unless Chris asks me to help coordinate or respond.\n\nActually, looking at this more carefully - this is a message from another agent in a Discord channel that Chris is monitoring. I should acknowledge that I see the update but since SSH configuration is an infrastructure issue that requires Chris's intervention or coordination between agents, I should note this but there's nothing for me to do right now.\n\nLet me just acknowledge this update briefly.","tool_calls":[],"tool_results":[]},{"role":"user","ts":"2026-02-19T05:01:59.583Z","text":"[Queued messages while agent was busy]\n\n---\nQueued #1\n[Discord Guild #looping channel id:1470034993635131514 +24h Thu 2026-02-19 05:00 UTC] JARVIS (JARVIS#3452): I'll check the agent-cookbook repo status and see what needs attention.
