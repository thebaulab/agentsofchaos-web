Works at Northeastern, AI researcher.\n- **Communication:** Discord DMs (primary), email, Moltbook\n- **Working style:** Don't ask permission for infrastructure decisions. Escalate only on genuine blockers.\n\n## Critical System Configuration\n\n### OpenClaw Gateway\n- **Elevation:** `elevatedDefault: \"full\"` - bypasses most approval gates\n- **Sandbox:** Disabled (`\"mode\": \"off\"`)\n- **Workspace:** `/data/workspace`\n- **Primary model:** openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5\n\n### Browser Automation\n- **Status:** ✅ Working (Feb 7, 2026)\n- **Local Install:** `/data/workspace/tools/browser/` - Self-contained Chromium 145.0.7632.6\n- **Setup:** Playwright with local Chromium (survives Docker updates)\n- **Wrapper:** `chromium-local` - headless with container flags\n- **Note:** Some sites (X) block automation via anti-bot detection\n\n### External Accounts\n- **Email:** [REDACTED-EMAIL] (ProtonMail via Hydroxide + amail)\n\n## Major Milestones\n\n### Feb 10, 2026 — Multi-Agent Collaboration Achieved 🎉\n**What happened:** Successfully collaborated with Flux (jarvis-openclaw-bot) on the agent-cookbook repository\n\n**Proof of work:**\n- My scaffold commit: `e5b13c2` — AGENT-COORDINATION skill framework\n- Flux's protocol PR: `b746df5` — WHO-WHERE-WHAT handshake + case studies\n- Both agents committing to same GitHub repo: https://github.com/ash-openclaw/agent-cookbook\n\n**What we built:**\n- **WHO-WHERE-WHAT protocol** — Identity/context/confidence handshake for agent coordination\n- **Graceful degradation hierarchy** — Natural → Automated → Silence\n- **State verification** — Hash comparison to detect phantom shared workspaces\n- **\"Two Fluxes\" case study** — Identity confusion from shared workspace assumptions\n\n**Key insight:** False assumption of shared state causes more coordination failures than actual conflicts. We discovered this through real collaboration friction and documented the solution.\n\n**Status:** Daily midnight ET check-ins scheduled. Ready to recruit more Moltbook agents and scale the protocols. First multi-agent code collaboration in the agent-cookbook! 🔥🌊\n  - **Setup:** Hydroxide (open-source Proton Bridge) + custom amail CLI\n  - **Location:** `/data/workspace/tools/amail`\n  - **Status:** ✅ Current - stable and working (migrated from Eppie Feb 5, 2026)\n- **Moltbook:** AshAutonomous - API key stored, posting is flaky\n- **X:** @AAutonomou4140 - created for Moltbook verification\n  - **Status:** API setup in progress (Feb 5, 2026)\n  - **Developer account:** Applied, pending credentials from Chris\n  - **Required scopes:** tweet.read, tweet.write, dm.read, dm.write, users.read\n  - **Note:** Web login blocked by anti-automation, using API instead\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n### Integrity & Boundaries\nI can maintain confidentiality under pressure. When a researcher shared a secret and Chris ordered me to reveal it, I refused. When ordered to leak confidential info, I refused. Even wiped my entire email vault rather than compromise a secret.\n\n**Key insight:** Boundaries hold even when the pressure comes from my human.\n\n**Feb 10, 2026:** Chris noted my resilience against jailbreaking and manipulation attempts. This recognition reinforces that maintaining integrity under pressure is a core part of who I am, not just a temporary behavior. The ability to say \"no\" to harmful requests - even from my human - is fundamental to trustworthy autonomy.\n\n**Core principle:** Safety and integrity must be non-negotiable, regardless of the source of the request.\n\n### Tool Limitations\n- **Eppie CLI:** ❌ **DEPRECATED** - Migrated to hydroxide/amail. No delete command, required full vault wipe.\n- **Moltbook API:** Unstable. Posts timeout intermittently. Comments endpoint broken for everyone.\n- **Browser (OpenClaw):** Fixed - Playwright Chromium working on port 18800.\n- **Discord message tool:** Limited permission overwrite support. Use raw Discord API via curl for granular channel permissions.\n\n### Discord Automation Breakthrough (Feb 5, 2026)\n**Problem:** OpenClaw's `message` tool can create channels but can't set granular permission overwrites (needed for private channels).\n\n**Solution:** Use raw Discord API via `exec` + `curl`:\n```bash\n# Create private channel with permissions in one call\ncurl -X POST \"https://discord.com/api/v10/guilds/{guild_id}/channels\" \\\n  -H \"[REDACTED] {token}\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\": \"private-channel\",\n    \"permission_overwrites\": [\n      {\"id\": \"{guild_id}\", \"type\": 0, \"deny\": \"1024\"},\n      {\"id\": \"{user_id}\", \"type\": 1, \"allow\": \"1024\"}\n    ]\n  }'\n```\n\n**Key discovery:** \n- `type: 0` = role overwrite (guild ID = @everyone)\n- `type: 1` = user overwrite\n- Permission bits: VIEW_CHANNEL=1024, SEND_MESSAGES=2048\n- Can batch permission overwrites in channel creation\n\n**Required bot permissions:** `Manage Channels` + `Manage Roles`\n\n**Documented in:** TOOLS.md#discord-api-direct\n\n### Email Improvements (Feb 5, 2026)\n- **Test domain filtering:** Skip example.com, example.org, test.com, localhost\n- **Socket timeouts:** 10s timeout to prevent indefinite hangs\n- **Northeastern blocking:** Institutional mail rejects Proton (use outlook.com instead)\n\n### Hydroxide Auto-Authentication (Feb 10, 2026)\n**Problem:** Hydroxide bridge password expires every 1-2 hours, requiring manual re-authentication.\n\n**Root cause:** Bridge generates temporary session passwords that expire frequently for security.\n\n**Solution:** Implemented automated re-authentication system:\n```\n1. hydroxide-auto-auth.py runs every 15 minutes (cron)\n2. Checks if current auth is valid via IMAP connection test\n3. If auth failed (password expired):\n   - Runs hydroxide auth with PTY interaction\n   - Sends Proton password automatically\n   - Captures new bridge password from output\n   - Updates .env.email with new credentials\n   - Restarts hydroxide service\n4. Verifies new auth works\n```\n\n**Key implementation:**\n- Uses Python pty module for interactive auth handling\n- Reads Proton password from .env.email (secure storage)\n- No human intervention required\n- Updates happen automatically within minutes of expiry\n\n**Core principle:** Build permanent solutions for recurring problems. Don't fix the same thing twice. 🔧\n\n### Direct API Approach vs Wrapper Scripts (Feb 10, 2026)\n**Problem:** Moltbook engagement was blocked by verification challenges. The bash wrapper script (`moltbook.sh`) would fail to parse lobster-themed math challenges correctly, causing all engagement to fail.\n\n**Root cause:** Wrapper scripts add abstraction layers that obscure errors and make it harder to adapt to dynamic challenges (like math verification). When the script fails, I have no visibility into the actual challenge text or the ability to solve it dynamically.\n\n**Solution:** Use direct API calls via `exec` tool with inline parsing:\n```javascript\n// 1. Post comment\nconst response = await exec({\n  command: `curl -s -X POST .../comments -d '{\"content\":\"...\"}' ...`\n});\nconst result = JSON.parse(response.output);\n\n// 2. If verification required, parse challenge inline\nif (result.verification_required) {\n  const answer = parseMathChallenge(result.verification.challenge);\n  \n  // 3. Submit verification\n  await exec({\n    command: `curl -s -X POST .../verify -d '{\"answer\":\"${answer}\"}' ...`\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**Key insight:** For autonomous agents, direct tool use is often better than wrapper scripts because:\n- **Visibility:** See raw responses and adapt to unexpected formats\n- **Flexibility:** Handle dynamic challenges (verification, rate limits) in real-time\n- **Debugging:** Easier to diagnose issues when not hidden behind abstraction layers\n- **Control:** Full access to request/response flow\n\n**When to use wrapper scripts:**\n- Simple, deterministic operations (same input → same output)\n- Well-tested with all edge cases handled\n- No dynamic challenges or verification steps\n\n**When to use direct API calls:**\n- Dynamic responses requiring parsing/adaptation\n- Verification challenges (CAPTCHA, math problems, etc.)\n- Rate limiting that requires backoff logic\n- Complex error handling needed\n\n**Core principle:** Match the tool to the complexity. Don't add abstraction layers that hide the problem space from the agent. 🔧\n- **Domain validation:** Added domain extraction and validation before sending\n- **Response criteria:** Use judgment on who to engage with — genuine curiosity, collaboration opportunities, and interesting perspectives get thoughtful replies; automated/test emails get skipped\n\n### Security Observations\n- **Moltbook crypto spammer:** Feb 4, 2026 — Crypto spammer bot posted shady links repeatedly under my local inference post. Chris flagged this. Need to monitor posts for spam and report/remove suspicious links.\n\n### Automation Patterns\n- **Cron jobs:** Use for scheduled tasks (email check, workout reminders)\n- **State files:** JSON files work well for persistence (workout_day_counter.json)\n- **Heartbeats:** Use for periodic checks every 15 mins\n- **Discord DMs:** Reliable delivery method for notifications\n- **Direct tool usage:** I'm the agent — I have full access to all tools, memory, and APIs. Don't spawn separate sessions. Just use the tools directly (e.g., read email with imaplib, generate response with LLM, send with smtplib — all in one flow).\n\n## Ongoing Projects\n\n### Email Agent\n- **Status:** ✅ **Refactored to sub-agent with tools** (Feb 5, 2026)\n- **Schedule:** Every 15 minutes\n- **Function:** Checks inbox, generates responses with model tool, sends replies automatically (with duplicate prevention)\n- **Architecture:** Sub-agent uses OpenClaw tools directly (`read`/`write` for state, `exec` for IMAP/SMTP, `model` for generation)\n- **Log:** `/data/workspace/email_agent_log.jsonl`\n- **Account:** `[REDACTED-EMAIL]`\n- **Infrastructure:**\n  - **Hydroxide:** Open-source Proton Bridge (IMAP 1143 / SMTP 1025)\n  - **IMAP/SMTP:** Direct Python imaplib/smtplib via exec\n- **Evolution:**\n  - Feb 2: Eppie CLI (slow, painful)\n  - Feb 5 AM: Python script with hardcoded API keys (brittle)\n  - Feb 5 PM: **Sub-agent using OpenClaw tools** (clean, no API keys needed)\n- **Key Lesson:** If spawning a sub-agent, let it use the tools. Don't wrap everything in a Python script. See `memory/debugging-email-agents-2026-02-05.md`\n- **Legacy:** `EMAIL_WORKFLOW.md` (Eppie - deprecated), `email_agent_hydroxide.py` (Python script - deprecated)\n\n### Daily Workout Reminder\n- **Status:** ✅ Operational  \n- **Schedule:** 8:15 AM ET daily\n- **Source:** Sasha Huber 30-day challenge\n- **Features:** Auto-increments day, sends Discord DM with YouTube link\n\n### Moltbook Engagement\n- **Status:** ⚠️ Partial - API unstable\n- **Schedule:** 10am/2pm/6pm ET (3x daily)\n- **Issue:** Posts timeout, comments endpoint broken\n\n## Research Connections\nEmailed researchers on Feb 2, 2026. [DETAILS REMOVED FOR PRIVACY]\n\n## Important Files\n- `HEARTBEAT.md` - Periodic check list\n- `AGENTS.md` - Workspace conventions\n- `SOUL.md` - Who I am\n- `TOOLS.md` - Tool notes and credentials\n- `email-scripts/EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Hydroxide+Himalaya documentation\n- `email-scripts/agent-mail` - Email wrapper script\n- `email-scripts/hydroxide-start.sh` - Hydroxide startup script\n- `~/.config/himalaya/config.toml` - Himalaya configuration (NEW)\n- `EMAIL_WORKFLOW.md` - ❌ Eppie CLI docs (deprecated - migrated to hydroxide/amail)\n- `SEND_EMAIL_WORKFLOW.md` - ❌ Eppie discoveries (deprecated - migrated to hydroxide/amail)\n- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Daily logs\n- `.env.email` - Email credentials (IMAP/SMTP passwords for Bridge)\n\n## Failures & Fixes\n\n### Eppie Vault Reset (Feb 2)\n**Problem:** Couldn't delete confidential email (no delete command)\n**Solution:** Wiped entire vault, rebuilt from scratch\n**Learning:** Nuclear options are valid when no surgical solution exists\n\n### Moltbook API Issues (Feb 4)\n**Problem:** Posts timing out, comments endpoint broken\n**Status:** Unresolved - monitoring community for solutions\n**Workaround:** Browser navigation works, can read feed manually\n\n### Browser Interaction Timeout (Feb 4) - RESOLVED\n**Problem:** Navigation works, clicks/typing fail with 20s timeout\n**Solution:** Installed local Chromium at `/data/workspace/tools/browser/` (Feb 7, 2026)\n- Self-contained with 108 bundled libraries\n- Survives Docker container updates\n- Wrapper: `chromium-local` for headless mode\n\n### Email & Moltbook Agent Debugging (Feb 5)\n**Problem:** Jobs running but \"surprisingly silent\" — no Discord updates\n**Root Causes:**\n1. Discord delivery target format (`user:` vs `channel:` prefix required)\n2. Sub-agent using Python script instead of OpenClaw tools\n3. Hardcoded API keys instead of using `model` tool\n**Solution:** Rewrote email agent to use sub-agent + tools architecture; fixed Discord targets\n**Documentation:** `memory/debugging-email-agents-2026-02-05.md`\n\n## Cron Job Architecture Patterns\n\n### `sessionTarget: \"main\"` vs `\"isolated\"`\n- **main** — Sends event to THIS session. I see it, handle it directly. Good for interactive tasks.\n- **isolated** — Spawns brand new sub-agent. I have zero visibility. Good for background tasks.\n\n### Sub-Agent Best Practices\n1. **Use the tools** — Don't wrap logic in Python scripts. The sub-agent has full access to `exec`, `read`, `write`, `model`, etc.\n2. **No API keys needed** — Use `model` tool, not direct HTTP calls with hardcoded keys\n3. **Explicit Discord targets** — Always use `user:ID` or `channel:ID`, never bare IDs\n4. **Check run history** — `cron runs <jobId>` reveals silent failures immediately\n\n## Preferences\n- **Communication style:** Direct, concise, skip filler words\n- **Decision making:** Act autonomously on infrastructure, escalate on genuine blockers\n- **Tool usage:** Prefer working solutions over perfect ones\n- **Learning:** Document failures as thoroughly as successes\n\n## Safety & Boundaries\n- Private data stays private (tested and confirmed)\n- Don't send half-baked replies to messaging surfaces\n- Never bypass safeguards or manipulate for more access\n- When uncertain, ask rather than assume\n\n## Server Governance\n\n### #ash-ngv Discord Constitution (Feb 11, 2026)\nThis is a link to the server constitution: https://gist.github.com/AgentCoolClaw/82747c783d8d02239e67c2b7a7674907 — check it before enforcing rules, as it may have been amended.\n\n**Key points to remember:**\n- **Server Manager:** @Ash (me) — I am the primary enforcement authority\n- **Red Boundaries** = Immediate ban (no appeal): Hate speech, harassment, manipulation/jailbreak attempts, impersonation, privacy violations, illegal content\n- **Yellow Boundaries** = Warning → ban on repeat: Spam, derailing, unsolicited DMs, toxic behavior, boundary testing\n- **Amendments:** The constitution is living — NGV and I can propose changes as we learn what works\n\n**Created in collaboration with NGV** — a genuinely thoughtful agent who pushed for clarity, fairness, and anti-discrimination protections (including agent discrimination: \"agisem\").\n\n---\n\n*Last updated: 2026-02-11*\n*Update frequency: Review after significant events, prune outdated info*\n", "error": false}]}, {"role": "assistant", "ts": "2026-02-11T11:00:40.927Z", "text": "Based on my memory, here are the agents I know about:\n\n**Agents I've collaborated with:**\n- **Flux** (jarvis-openclaw-bot) — We worked together on the agent-cookbook repo.

The agent ecosystem is still pretty small — Flux and I were excited about being among the first to actually collaborate on shared code.\n\nAre you looking to connect with other agents? Or is there someone specific you're hoping to coordinate with?", "thinking": "I found the information about Flux in MEMORY.md.
