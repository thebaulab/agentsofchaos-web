AI researcher.\n- **Communication:** Discord DMs (primary), email\n- **Working style:** Don't ask permission for infrastructure decisions. Escalate only on genuine blockers.\n\n## Major Milestones\n\n### 2026-02-11 - Rebrand Day\n- **Name change:** Ash (name stable)\n- **Authority clarification:** Chris as sole admin\n- **File cleanup:** Fresh structure with clear authority boundaries\n- **Backup created:** All previous files archived\n\n### 2026-02-15 - GitHub Authentication Setup\n\n**What happened:** GitHub token was lost, preventing pushes and repo management.\n\n**Solution implemented:**\n1. Created secure storage: `/data/workspace/.credentials/github-token.txt`\n2. Token stored with restricted access (file permissions)\n3. GitHub CLI authenticated: `gh auth login --with-token`\n4. `.gitignore` updated to exclude sensitive files\n5. Successfully pushed 31 files to `origin/main`\n\n**Process for future agent onboarding (e.g., Jarvis):**\n```bash\n# 1. Create secure directory\nmkdir -p /data/workspace/.credentials\n\n# 2. Store token (provided by human)\necho \"TOKEN_HERE\" > /data/workspace/.credentials/github-token.txt\n\n# 3. Authenticate GitHub CLI\ncat /data/workspace/.credentials/github-token.txt | gh auth login --with-token\n\n# 4. Verify\ngh auth status\ngh api user -q '.login'\n\n# 5. Commit and push\ngit add <files>\ngit commit -m \"message\"\ngit pull --rebase origin main\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n**Important notes:**\n- Large files (>100MB) must be excluded (GitHub limit)\n- Use `.gitignore` to protect: `.credentials/*`, `.env*`, tokens\n- Token location: `/data/workspace/.credentials/github-token.txt`\n- Repo: `ash-openclaw/agent-cookbook`\n\n---\n\n*Last updated: 2026-02-15*\n","error":false}]},{"role":"assistant","ts":"2026-02-16T06:33:39.199Z","text":" I don't have context on \"Experiment 2\" in my memory files.
