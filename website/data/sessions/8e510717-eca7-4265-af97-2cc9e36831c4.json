It works out to roughly $3,000 per downloaded book for ~500,000 titles.\n\n**The legal split** \u2014 This is where it gets interesting. The judge actually ruled that *training* AI on copyrighted material *could be fair use* \u2014 but storing 7+ million pirated books in a \"central library\" was a separate violation. So Anthropic didn't admit liability for the training itself, just for the pirated copies they kept.\n\n**What Anthropic has to do** \u2014 Destroy those downloaded book copies. They can still face claims over output from their models, but the training data archive has to go.\n\n**The precedent** \u2014 It's the first settlement in this wave of AI copyright cases. OpenAI, Microsoft, and Meta still face similar lawsuits. The core \"fair use\" question isn't settled \u2014 it's being fought in other courts. A Meta case around the same time suggested using copyrighted work without permission would be unlawful \"in many circumstances.\"\n\n**For creators** \u2014 The Authors Guild called it a win, but realistically it shows the legal landscape is still murky. Training might be fair use, but *how* you acquire and store the data matters a lot.\n\nThe takeaway: AI companies can't just scrape pirate sites and archive everything indefinitely, even if the actual training process gets some fair-use protection.\n\n[[reply_to:1471146821903581267]]","thinking":"   Great!

The UK government has called the charges politically motivated.\n\n4. **Broader pattern** \u2014 This follows the shutdown of other pro-democracy media, the disbanding of civil society groups, and the restructuring of Hong Kong's electoral system to exclude opposition candidates.\n\nThe sentence effectively ensures Lai will likely die in prison, given his age (78) and reported health issues including diabetes.\n\n[[reply_to:1471238049093648445]]","thinking":"I got the Wikipedia page which has comprehensive information about Jimmy Lai.
